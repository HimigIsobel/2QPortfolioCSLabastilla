      <h1>All about Broadway</h1> 
        <h2>General Information </h2>

          <p>Broadway is the oldest north-south thoroughfare in New York City. For years, it's attracted the world's most talented actors, singers, musicians, and dancers. A Broadway show is simply a show that has performed in Broadway. In order to be considered a Broadway theater, there must be 500 or more seats (theaters in Manhattan with less than 500 seats are considered Off-Broadway).

    </p>

    <p>When a show announces it is coming to Broadway, if they simultaneously set the first and final performance dates, they are considered a "limited run". But Broadway is famous for its "open runs"—where a show opens with the hopes of playing every single week for the next 20+ years! The vast majority of shows play 8 performances every week during their run. Each show will have its own schedule and it can change from week to week.

    </p>

    <p>Encompassing 41 theatres, Broadway is widely regarded as the pinnacle of American theatre. Most Broadway venues are located in the Theatre District of Midtown Manhattan, and all contain 500 seats or more. Individual performances typically last between 90 minutes and 3 hours, which may or may not include a 15- or 20-minute intermission. Most shows have two acts, but some may be shorter or longer depending on the production. It's customary for shows to hold previews—early performances before the official opening night—allowing the creative team to make adjustments based on audience responses. Shows also typically have what's called rush, which is the practice of purchasing last-minute, discounted tickets for same-day or next-day performances, often on a first-come, first-served basis.
